# ab_mover
Command line utility to read an [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) metadata.json file and generate bash to create a directory structure based on it.

THIS DOES NOT ACUTALLY MOVE OR COPY FILES ITSELF. This application generates mkdir and mv/cp commands that can be executed from a terminal or the output can be redirected into a shellscript. It is up to the user to look over the generated statements to make sure they are sane and aren't going to destroy their audiobbook library. 

Requirements: Python 3.10, Audiobookshelf, with the "Store metadata with item" enabled in settings.

## `ab_mover` Utility

### Overview
The `ab_mover` utility is a Python application designed to organize audiobook files into a structured directory format. The script processes audiobook metadata and moves or copies the files into a user-defined directory structure. It supports features like extracting book numbers from titles or series names, creating necessary directories, and handling various command-line options for flexibility.

### Features
- **Metadata Processing:** Reads metadata from `metadata.json` files to extract information such as title, author, and series.
- **Book Number Extraction:** Automatically extracts book numbers from directory names or series metadata.
- **Directory Organization:** Moves or copies files into a structured directory format based on author, series, and series number.
- **Command-Line Options:** Offers flexibility with options for copying files, enabling debug logs, and specifying a custom top-level directory.
- **Debug Logging:** Provides detailed logging for debugging purposes when enabled.

### Usage
```sh
./ab_mover <base_directory> [-c] [--debug] [-t <top_level_directory>]
```

### Command-Line Arguments
- `base_directory`: The base directory to search for audiobooks.
- `-c, --copy`: Copy files instead of moving them. By default, files are moved.
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging for detailed information about the script's operations.
- `-t, --top-level-dir`: Specify a custom top-level directory for audiobooks. The default is `/Audiobooks`.

### How It Works
1. **Walking Through Directories:** The script recursively walks through the specified base directory to locate `metadata.json` files.
2. **Processing Metadata:** For each `metadata.json` file found, the script extracts the title, authors, series, and potentially the book number.
3. **Directory Creation:** Based on the extracted metadata, the script constructs a target directory path in the form of `<top_level_directory>/<author>/<series>/Book <book_number>`.
4. **File Movement/Copying:** The script generates and prints bash commands to move or copy the files from the source to the target directories, depending on the specified options.
